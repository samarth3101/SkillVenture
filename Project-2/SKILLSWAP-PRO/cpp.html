            <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
            <p>
                C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that is widely used for system/software development, game programming, and performance-critical applications. Developed as an extension of the C programming language, C++ incorporates both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing for more complex and scalable code design.
            </p>
            <p>
                C++ is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and control over system resources, making it a preferred choice for applications requiring high performance and resource management. From operating systems to real-time simulations, C++ plays a crucial role in a variety of software solutions.
