            <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
            <p>
                Java is a versatile, high-level programming language that is widely used for building platform-independent applications. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code written in Java can run on any device equipped with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
            </p>
            <p>
                Known for its simplicity, object-oriented design, and strong community support, Java is commonly used in web development, mobile applications (especially Android), and enterprise-level solutions. Its robust ecosystem, featuring extensive libraries and frameworks, makes it a top choice for developers around the world.
