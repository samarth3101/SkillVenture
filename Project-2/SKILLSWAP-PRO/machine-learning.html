            <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. By using algorithms and statistical models, ML allows computers to recognize patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes based on historical data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The field of machine learning has grown exponentially in recent years due to the increasing availability of large datasets and the advances in computational power. From self-driving cars to recommendation systems on streaming platforms, ML is at the core of many technological innovations today.

                Machine learning can be broadly classified into three categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> In this approach, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the correct output. The model learns to make predictions based on this input-output mapping. Common applications include classification and regression tasks, such as spam detection or house price prediction.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> This method involves training the model on data without labels. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data. Clustering and association are common tasks in unsupervised learning, like customer segmentation or market basket analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> In this paradigm, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It is commonly used in robotics, gaming, and navigation systems.</li>
            </ul>
